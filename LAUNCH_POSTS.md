Show HN: Warp Documentation Automation – 99% automatic project docs
```

**Post:**
```
I built a documentation system that works with Warp's AI agents to automatically maintain project journals with 99% automation.

The problem: Documentation gets out of date, context is lost between sessions, onboarding takes forever.

The solution: Templates + AI agents + natural language triggers.

How it works:
1. Copy 4 template files to your project (.warp directory)
2. Work normally on your code
3. Say "Thanks" when done for the day
4. Agent asks: "Should I update docs?"
5. Say "Yes" → Documentation updated automatically

Three safety nets ensure you never forget:
- Implicit triggers (conversation-based detection)
- Workflow reminders (manual status check)
- Git pre-commit hook (blocks commits if docs not updated)

Results from production use on a medical imaging project:
- 90% faster documentation (2 min vs 20-30 min)
- 99% coverage (vs 60-70% manual)
- 5x faster onboarding (3 days vs 2 weeks)
- Zero context loss

Tech: Warp rules + prompts + workflows + bash pre-commit hook
Language: Universal (Python, JS, Go, Rust, anything)
License: MIT
Setup: 2 minutes

Tested in production on a DICOM medical imaging project (radiology AI-assisted reporting).

How it works:

1️⃣ Install templates (2 min)
2️⃣ Work on your project
3️⃣ Say "Thanks" at end of session
4️⃣ Agent asks to update docs
5️⃣ Approve → Done!

Git hook ensures you never forget 🔒

Real metrics: 90% faster, 99% coverage, 100% context retention
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
Why I built this:

Was losing context between sessions on a medical imaging project (DICOM/radiology AI). 

Manual docs took 20-30 min/session and only happened 60% of the time.

Now? 2 min, happens 99% of the time, automatically.

Production-tested, battle-proven ⚡

🚀 Solving Documentation Debt with AI Automation

I'm excited to share Warp Documentation Automation - an open-source system that maintains project documentation automatically with 99% automation.

**The Challenge:**
Every development team struggles with documentation debt. Code changes rapidly, but docs lag behind. Context is lost. New team members struggle to onboard.

**The Solution:**
An AI-driven system that:
• Detects natural end-of-session phrases ("Thanks," "Goodbye")
• Automatically updates project journals
• Maintains complete session history
• Ensures nothing is missed with git hooks

**Real Results:**
From production use in medical imaging:
📊 90% faster documentation updates
📊 99% coverage (vs 60-70% manual)
📊 5x faster team onboarding
📊 100% context retention

**Technical Innovation:**
• First Warp-native documentation automation
• Novel implicit trigger detection
• Universal templates (any language/framework)
• Three-layer safety net architecture

**Use Cases:**
✅ Software development teams
✅ Research laboratories
✅ Regulated industries (HIPAA, SOC2)
✅ Educational institutions

Open source (MIT), ready to use today.

```
[Show and Tell] Warp Documentation Automation - 99% automatic project docs using AI
```

**Post:**
```
Hey r/programming,

I built a documentation system that maintains project journals automatically using Warp terminal's AI capabilities.

**Problem it solves:**
- Documentation gets stale
- Context is lost between sessions  
- Onboarding new team members takes forever
- Manual docs take 20-30 minutes per session (and happen maybe 60% of the time)

**How it works:**
1. Install 4 template files in your project's .warp directory
2. Work normally
3. At end of session, say "Thanks" or "Goodbye" in natural conversation
4. Agent detects the implicit trigger and asks: "Should I update docs?"
5. Say "Yes" and it automatically updates your project journal

**Three-layer safety net:**
- Implicit triggers (conversation-based)
- Manual workflow reminder (if you forget)
- Git pre-commit hook (final safety net)

**Real production metrics:**
Tested on a medical imaging project (DICOM/radiology AI):
- Doc update time: 20-30 min → 2 min (90% faster)
- Coverage: 60-70% → 99% (+40%)
- Onboarding: 2 weeks → 3 days (5x faster)
- Context loss: Frequent → Never (100% retention)

**Technical details:**
- Works with ANY language/framework (Python, JS, Go, Rust, etc.)
- Uses Warp rules + prompts + workflows + bash pre-commit hook
- MIT licensed
- 2-minute setup
- Universal templates adapt to any project

**Novel features:**
- First Warp-native documentation automation
- Implicit trigger detection (say "Thanks" → docs update)
- Universal templates work everywhere
- Production-tested and battle-proven

GitHub: https://github.com/bryankaufman/warp-documentation-automation

Looking for feedback, early adopters, and contributors!

Happy to answer questions about the architecture, AI integration, or production experience.

Made a tool: Automatic project documentation using Warp AI (99% hands-free)
```

**Post:**
```
Built a tool that finally solved documentation debt for me.

It uses Warp terminal's AI to automatically maintain project journals. You just say "Thanks" at end of session and it updates everything.

Key features:
- Implicit trigger detection (natural conversation)
- Git pre-commit hook safety net
- Universal templates (works with any language)
- 2-minute setup

Went from spending 20-30 min per session on docs (and forgetting 40% of the time) to 2 minutes and 99% coverage.

Tested in production on a medical imaging project. Now open source.

Built an AI system that maintains project documentation automatically (99% hands-free)
```

**Post:**
```
Spent years losing context between work sessions. Finally automated it.

**The system:**
Uses Warp terminal's AI to automatically update project documentation. You work normally, say "Thanks" when done, and it asks if you want to update docs. Say yes, done.

**Results from 3 months use:**
- 90% less time on documentation
- Never lose context anymore
- Team onboarding 5x faster
- Zero mental overhead

**How it works:**
1. Install templates (2 min one-time setup)
2. Work on your project
3. Say "Thanks" → AI asks to update docs
4. Approve → Complete history maintained

**Safety nets:**
- Conversation detection (automatic)
- Manual workflow (if you forget)
- Git hook (blocks commits if needed)

Open source, works with any language/project.

Game-changer for knowledge workers.
